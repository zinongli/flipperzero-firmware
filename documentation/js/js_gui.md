# GUI module {#js_gui}

The module allows you to use GUI (graphical user interface) in concepts off the Flipper Zero firmware. Call the `require` function to load the module before first using its methods. This module depends on the `event_loop` module, so it **must** be imported after the `event_loop` import:

```js
let eventLoop = require("event_loop");
let gui = require("gui");
```
## Submodules

GUI module has several submodules:

- @subpage js_gui__submenu — Displays a scrollable list of clickable textual entries
- @subpage js_gui__loading — Displays an animated hourglass icon
- @subpage js_gui__empty_screen — Just empty screen
- @subpage js_gui__text_input — Keyboard-like text input
- @subpage js_gui__text_box — Simple multiline text box
- @subpage js_gui__dialog — Dialog with up to 3 options
- @subpage js_gui__widget — Displays a combination of custom elements on one screen

## Conceptualizing GUI
### Event loop
It is highly recommended to familiarize yourself with the event loop first
before doing GUI-related things.

### Canvas
The canvas is just a drawing area with no abstractions over it. Drawing on the
canvas directly (i.e. not through a viewport) is useful in case you want to
implement a custom design element, but this is rather uncommon.

### Viewport
A viewport is a window into a rectangular portion of the canvas. Applications
always access the canvas through a viewport.

### View
In Flipper's terminology, a "View" is a fullscreen design element that assumes
control over the entire viewport and all input events. Different types of views
are available (not all of which are unfortunately currently implemented in JS):
| View                 | Has JS adapter?  |
|----------------------|------------------|
| `button_menu`        | ❌               |
| `button_panel`       | ❌               |
| `byte_input`         | ❌               |
| `dialog_ex`          | ✅ (as `dialog`) |
| `empty_screen`       | ✅               |
| `file_browser`       | ❌               |
| `loading`            | ✅               |
| `menu`               | ❌               |
| `number_input`       | ❌               |
| `popup`              | ❌               |
| `submenu`            | ✅               |
| `text_box`           | ✅               |
| `text_input`         | ✅               |
| `variable_item_list` | ❌               |
| `widget`             | ❌               |

In JS, each view has its own set of properties (or just "props"). The programmer
can manipulate these properties in two ways:
  - Instantiate a `View` using the `makeWith(props)` method, passing an object
    with the initial properties
  - Call `set(name, value)` to modify a property of an existing `View`

### View Dispatcher
The view dispatcher holds references to all the views that an application needs
and switches between them as the application makes requests to do so.

### Scene Manager
The scene manager is an optional add-on to the view dispatcher that makes
managing applications with complex navigation flows easier. It is currently
inaccessible from JS.

### Approaches
In total, there are three different approaches that you may take when writing
a GUI application:
| Approach       | Use cases                                                                    | Available from JS |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| ViewPort only  | Accessing the graphics API directly, without any of the nice UI abstractions | ❌                |
| ViewDispatcher | Common UI elements that fit with the overall look of the system              | ✅                |
| SceneManager   | Additional navigation flow management for complex applications               | ❌                |

## Example
An example with three different views using the ViewDispatcher approach:
```js
let eventLoop = require("event_loop");
let gui = require("gui");
let loadingView = require("gui/loading");
let submenuView = require("gui/submenu");
let emptyView = require("gui/empty_screen");

// Common pattern: declare all the views in an object. This is absolutely not
// required, but adds clarity to the script.
let views = {
    // the view dispatcher auto-✨magically✨ remembers views as they are created
    loading: loadingView.make(),
    empty: emptyView.make(),
    demos: submenuView.makeWith({
        items: [
            "Hourglass screen",
            "Empty screen",
            "Exit app",
        ],
    }),
};

// go to different screens depending on what was selected
eventLoop.subscribe(views.demos.chosen, function (_sub, index, gui, eventLoop, views) {
    if (index === 0) {
        gui.viewDispatcher.switchTo(views.loading);
    } else if (index === 1) {
        gui.viewDispatcher.switchTo(views.empty);
    } else if (index === 2) {
        eventLoop.stop();
    }
}, gui, eventLoop, views);

// go to the demo chooser screen when the back key is pressed
eventLoop.subscribe(gui.viewDispatcher.navigation, function (_sub, _, gui, views) {
    gui.viewDispatcher.switchTo(views.demos);
}, gui, views);

// run UI
gui.viewDispatcher.switchTo(views.demos);
eventLoop.run();
```

# API reference
## viewDispatcher
The `viewDispatcher` constant holds the `ViewDispatcher` singleton.

<br>

### viewDispatcher.switchTo(view)
Switches to a view, giving it control over the display and input.

**Parameters**
  - `view`: the `View` to switch to

<br>

### viewDispatcher.sendTo(direction)
Sends the viewport that the dispatcher manages to the front of the stackup
(effectively making it visible), or to the back (effectively making it
invisible).

**Parameters**
  - `direction`: either `"front"` or `"back"`

<br>

### viewDispatcher.sendCustom(event)
Sends a custom number to the `custom` event handler.

**Parameters**
  - `event`: number to send

<br>

### viewDispatcher.custom
An event loop `Contract` object that identifies the custom event source,
triggered by `ViewDispatcher.sendCustom(event)`.

<br>

### viewDispatcher.navigation
An event loop `Contract` object that identifies the navigation event source,
triggered when the back key is pressed.

<br>

### viewDispatcher.currentView
The `View` object currently being shown.

<br>

## ViewFactory
When you import a module implementing a view, a `ViewFactory` is instantiated. For example, in the example above, `loadingView`, `submenuView` and `emptyView` are view factories.

<br>

### ViewFactory.make()
Creates an instance of a `View`.

<br>

### ViewFactory.makeWith(props, children)
Creates an instance of a `View` and assigns initial properties from `props` and optionally a list of children.

**Parameters**
  - `props`: simple key-value object, e.g. `{ header: "Header" }`
  - `children`: optional array of children, e.g. `[ { element: "button", button: "right", text: "Back" } ]`

## View
When you call `ViewFactory.make()` or `ViewFactory.makeWith()`, a `View` is instantiated. For example, in the example above, `views.loading`, `views.demos` and `views.empty` are views.

<br>

### View.set(property, value)
Assign value to property by name.

**Parameters**
  - `property`: name of the property to change
  - `value`: value to assign to the property

<br>

### View.addChild(child)
Adds a child to the `View`.

**Parameters**
  - `child`: the child to add, e.g. `{ element: "button", button: "right", text: "Back" }`

The format of the `child` parameter depends on the type of View that you're working with. Look in the View documentation.

### View.resetChildren()
Removes all children from the `View`.

### View.setChildren(children)
Removes all previous children from the `View` and assigns new children.

**Parameters**
  - `children`: the array of new children, e.g. `[ { element: "button", button: "right", text: "Back" } ]`
